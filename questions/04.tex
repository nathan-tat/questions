% Question 4

% For now, have separate environments for question parts and question subparts (the next level) 
% Ideally would somehow implement it into a single "questionparts". I would just like the enumerate counter bold lol . 

\begin{question}
    This is the stem of a question.

    \begin{questionparts}
        \item This is part \textbf{(i)} of a question.
        \item This is part \textbf{(ii)}
        \begin{questionsubparts}
            \item This is part \textbf{(a)} of \textbf{(ii)}
        \end{questionsubparts}
    \end{questionparts}

\end{question}
