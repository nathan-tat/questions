% Question 4

% For now, have separate environments for question parts and question subparts (the next level) 
% Ideally would somehow implement it into a single "questionparts". I would just like the enumerate counter bold lol . 

\begin{question}
    This is the stem of a question.

    \begin{questionparts}
        \item This is part \textbf{(i)} of a question. \pts{2}
        \item This is part \textbf{(ii)} \pts{4}
        \begin{questionsubparts}
            \item This is part \textbf{(a)} of \textbf{(ii)}
        \end{questionsubparts}
    \end{questionparts}

\end{question}

\begin{solution}
    This solution makes use of a diagram. 

    \begin{figure}[!ht]
        \centering
        \includegraphics[width=0.4\textwidth]{img/example.jpeg}
    \end{figure}

    You can also include a tikz figure. I would recommend creating a new tex file in the /img/ directory and using the input command.
